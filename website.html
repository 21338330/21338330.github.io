        <h3>Types Of Pollution</h3>
        <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
        <p>Air pollution is a huge issue in the world nowadays, from the increase of vehicles on the road to boom in industry more and more gases such as carbon monoxide are getting released into the atmosphere and causing harm. Carbon monoxide is a product
            of burning fossil fuels and can be a problem in households when apliences like gas stoves and space heaters are left on. Another toxic element which is found in the air is lead which can be emitted by leaded aviation fuel and industrial metal
            founderies and this can cause lead poisoning which effects the kidneys. Another example of a harmful gases which pollutes our atmosphere is nitrogen oxides which are products of burning fossil fuels and they react in the atmosphere to form
            nitrogen dioxide which effects those with lung or heart conditions.

        </p>
        <h4>Water Pollution</h4>
        <p>Water pollution refers to any pollutants in our rivers, lakes, and seas. An example of this is sewage which is released into rivers and causes eutrophication which causes algal blooms and this has huge effects on the local ecosystem as the algae
            blocks light and stops photosynthesis. Agricultual pollution can also seep into the waters as animal waste is treated the same as human waste and over time is washed away and get into the ground water. Animal waste is usually stacked up into
            piles and often leak into the soil and ground water. Land pollution also can get into the water ways from littering. An example of this is when plastic is carried into the drains and once it reaches the drains it reaches the sea and sea life
            then the plastic is consumed and turned into micro-plastics. After this when the fish are caught humans consume these micro-plastics and this can put you at risk of cancer.
        </p>
        <h4>Noise and Light Pollution </h4>
        <p>Noise and light pollution are caused in urban environments by street lights and noise of vehicles mostly. Noise pollution in cities can contribute to hearing loss over time and studies have shown loud noise can contribute to high blood pressure
            and stress which can lead to heart problems. Noise pollution effects marine life aswell as sonar from ships create loud noises and dolphins and whales can get lost as they relay on sonar for navigation. Light pollution has also been seen to
            cuase health effects as it can cause impaired sleep and causes the circadian rythm to be off, this has been linked to depression in certain studies.
