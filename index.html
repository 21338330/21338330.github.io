                This website has been created in order to inform the people of Manchester that pollution may change the way they we live, as well as future generations. According to Greater Manchester Annual Status Report statistics,<a href="https://cleanairgm.com/data-hub/monitoring-reports/">1110 people in Greater Mancheser have die due to toxic air</a>.
                Many hidden statistics, which are included on this page, outline how crutial it is as Mancunians to take action to save out city as well as our world. We hope that this page educates you so that you to tackle this global problem!

            <h2>Types Of Pollution</h2>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Air Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Air pollution is a huge issue in the world nowadays, from the increase of vehicles on the road to boom in industry more and more gases such as carbon monoxide are getting released into the atmosphere and causing harm. Carbon monoxide is
                    a product of burning fossil fuels and can be a problem in households when apliences like gas stoves and space heaters are left on. Another toxic element which is found in the air is lead which can be emitted by leaded aviation fuel
                    and industrial metal founderies and this can cause lead poisoning which effects the kidneys. Another example of a harmful gases which pollutes our atmosphere is nitrogen oxides which are products of burning fossil fuels and they react
                    in the atmosphere to form nitrogen dioxide which effects those with lung or heart conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Water Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Water pollution refers to any pollutants in our rivers, lakes, and seas. An example of this is sewage which is released into rivers and causes eutrophication which causes algal blooms and this has huge effects on the local ecosystem as
                    the algae blocks light and stops photosynthesis. Agricultual pollution can also seep into the waters as animal waste is treated the same as human waste and over time is washed away and get into the ground water. Animal waste is usually
                    stacked up into piles and often leak into the soil and ground water. Land pollution also can get into the water ways from littering. An example of this is when plastic is carried into the drains and once it reaches the drains it reaches
                    the sea and sea life then the plastic is consumed and turned into micro-plastics. After this when the fish are caught humans consume these micro-plastics and this can put you at risk of cancer.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Noise and Light Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Noise and light pollution are caused in urban environments by street lights and noise of vehicles mostly. Noise pollution in cities can contribute to hearing loss over time and studies have shown loud noise can contribute to high blood
                    pressure and stress which can lead to heart problems. Noise pollution effects marine life aswell as sonar from ships create loud noises and dolphins and whales can get lost as they relay on sonar for navigation. Light pollution has
                    also been seen to cuase health effects as it can cause impaired sleep and causes the circadian rythm to be off, this has been linked to depression in certain studies.

                Renewable energy solutions
            </h2>

            <p>
                <b>Solar panels</b> - Solar panels seem somewhat impractical in the UK where it rains most of the time. but it would be useful to make use of as many natural resources as possible. Buildings use about 40% of the world’s energy. Putting
                solar panels on the roofs and on the sides of many high-rise buildings would aid in renewable energy production to help power big co-operations in Manchester city centre.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Spiral wind turbines</b> – Spiral wind turbines would be useful on top of tall and short buildings in the city centre. They are less dangerous than conventional wind turbines and far more efficient when capturing air. They can be easily
                inaugurated into buildings are less dangerous to birds.
            </p>

            </h2>

            <p>
                <b>EV Charging</b> - EV charging stations can be positioned at car parks and houses. EV charging stations around the city center.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Sythetic Fuel</b> - Synthetic fuel from carbon capture and an ethanol fuel mix could replace focil fuel at filling stations. These type of fuel burn cleaner and help cars run better, but they do cost a lot to make. CO2 extractors can
                be placed near the road side and the gutters to condence and collect CO2 from cars
